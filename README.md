## About

Is a SPA which allows the user to visualize dog breeds from an external API, also filter and sort them by differents features such us weight, height, life span.
Users can also create thier own breeds by filling a controlled form. The created breed will be saved on a data base, and also will be showed on the page with the others breeds.
